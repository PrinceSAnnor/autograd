//short essay on my experience
/*
Reading through the lesson and doing the
assignment was very much fun since it is
my first time coding using a phone and i 
can quickly compile and see the result and 
also it was not as difficult since i have 
been exposed to coding(c++) previously.

One challenge i faced doing the assignment 
was trying to replicate the interface and 
position the elements to the right pixels.

another challenge i faced while coding was, 
i could not zoom in and out to my codes
on APDE.

In conclusion, it was very exciting as a 
first assignment and i hope to learn a lot 
and find more exciting stuff from the
program.
