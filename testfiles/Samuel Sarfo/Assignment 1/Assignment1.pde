  //Coding is really fun!It tests your numerical,accuracy,logic and organizational skills.It can also give you a tough time if your code doesn't run as expected.
  //whiles some parts seem to be easy, others make you revise the notes and keep you analysing every single code.
  //The challenging aspect was getting my phone's screen size.The information i got online for the specification didn't match.So i guess you know what i did?Haha.Just choosing arbitrary figures and running the code several times. It was hectic 
  //There is also the tendency to think your code will run as expected but only to realize you left something out
  //Also, I was getting information on the console that I'm missing a semicolon when i typed textsize ().Changing it to size () worked perfectly. I would appreciate it you highlight on that for me.
  //Finally,i can also write at least a single line of code üòÇüòÇüòÅThank you Suacode team
